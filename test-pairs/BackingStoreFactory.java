/**
 * A factory for creating BackingStore(s). Every provider must provide an

 * <p>
 * The <code>createBackingStore(env)</code> method is called typically during
 * container creation time. A store instance is typically used to store state
 * for a single container whose id is passed (as appId) to
 * <code>createStore()</code> method.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The <code>createBatchBackingStore()</code> method will be called whenever
 * the container decides to save a set of states that belong different
 * applications. Thus the store returned by createBatchBackingStore method is
 * different from createBackingStore in that the data passed in the collection
 * may potentially be from different containers/applications.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Any runtime exception thrown from createBackingStore and
 * createBatchBackingStore method will cause the container to use a default
 * persistence-type (typically no replication) and a log message will be logged
 * at WARNING level.
