1.  Create a database called 'maven' in your PostgreSQL rdbms.

2.  Make sure 'enable_seqscan = off' is set in your postgresql.conf
    configuration file.  This is a non-default setting, so it is very
    likely you will need to edit your postgresql config.

    NOTE:  Our queries perform very, very badly if the query optimizer
    is allowed to consider seqscans.

3.  Make sure the current user can log into the 'maven' database without
    specifying a password on the command line.  In other words, make sure
    this command works:

       psql maven

4.  Obtain the 'files.xz' and 'sigs.xz' raw dumps of the extracted Maven
    signatures.

    They should be here (via scp/ssh):

        tl.cs.uvic.ca:/opt/maven-signatures/*.xz

5.  Run the data-loading script.  They are located inside
    the './db/bulk-load/' of your 'sig-extractor' svn checkout:

        cd ./db/bulk-load/
        ./loadData.sh [path/to/files.xz] [path/to/sigs.xz]

6.  Wait a couple hours for the scripts to finish!
